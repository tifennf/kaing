# Kaing's Game

Kaing's Game is a turn-based board game. <br>  
It is about aligning 5 dots in order to form a "Kaing" and to win. <br>   
You can play it on paper like that:  <br>

- you take a squared paper sheet
- 2 pens of differents colors ( player 1 and player 2 )
- each in turn, a player will put a dot/cross on a intersection
- first to make a Kaing win !

Of course, you can play it with more players.   

---

The game is modeled with a square matrix of size n ( n = 30 by default ). <br>
In each case we have, 

- 0 for empty case
- k for a dot from player k where k range from 1 to +inf

I did that project in order to learn Go language   <br>

# Kaing's Game

Kaing's Game is a turn-based board game.   
It is about aligning 5 dots in order to form a "Kaing" and to win   
You can play it on paper like that:  

- you take a squared paper sheet
- 2 pens of differents colors ( player 1 and player 2 )
- each in turn, a player will put a dot/cross on a intersection
- first to make a Kaing win !

Of course, you can play it with more players.
